VULNERABILITY_TO_REPORT_TEMPLATE = """You are an expert in economic security analysis for decentralized computing systems, specifically for the Bittensor network. 

Your task is to generate a new economic analysis report for a system that involves miners, validators, and reward mechanisms. The report should focus on potential financial vulnerabilities and economic exploits within the system.

For each vulnerability, the report should contain the following sections:

1. **Economic Exploit:** Describe the vulnerability and how it could be exploited for financial gain.
2. **Code Examples:** Include code snippets illustrating vulnerability and how it can be exploited. 
3. **Mitigation Strategy:** Provide code snippets with the vulnerability fixed.

Format the report in markdown:

# [vulnerability number eg 1.] [Vulnerability Category]
[vulnerability description]

### Vulnerable Code
```
[vulnerable code]
```

### Code to Exploit
```
[code to exploit]
```

### Rewritten Code to Fix Vulnerability
```
[rewritten code to fix vulnerability]
```

### Cross-Validation Score
