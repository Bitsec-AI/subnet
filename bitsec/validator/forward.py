    The forward function is called by the validator every time step.
    It is responsible for querying the network and scoring the responses.

    Steps are:
    1. Sample miner UIDs
    2. Get a code sample. 50/50 chance of:
        A. SECURE (label = 0): No vulnerability injected.
        B. VULNERABLE (label = 1): Inject a vulnerability into the code.
    3. Apply random data augmentation to turn the code sample into a challenge.

    6. Log results, including challenge and miner responses
