# Weak Access Control

## Overview

Weak access control mechanisms can allow unauthorized users or malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to critical functions or data within a smart contract. Access control is crucial in ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with specific functionalities or modify crucial parameters.

## Description

Proper access control measures, such as role-based permissions and strong authentication mechanisms, must be implemented to prevent unauthorized access. Clearly documenting these limitations and abilities of actors within the system can help highlight which actions are at risk for critical vulnerabilities. This kind of documentation can facilitate improved unit testing and the identification of potential conflicts, ensuring that the system operates as intended and minimizes the risks of critical vulnerabilities from a single missing check. Projects should also make sure roles are limited as much as possible in their allowed actions to prevent risks from the web2 world causing irreparable damage to the system as a whole. A compromised private key is incredibly devastating if roles are not granular enough, or if the protocol relies heavily on centralization as a security model.

## Prevention

To prevent weak access control vulnerabilities, developers should implement role-based access control mechanisms. Clearly define roles and their associated permissions within the contractâ€™s documentation. Implement strong signature verification and use verified and tested libraries. Regularly review and update access control mechanisms to address any changes in system requirements or user roles.

## Examples

Enzyme Finance rewarded a researcher for identifying a vulnerability stemming from an integration with an external component called The Gas Station Network. The Gas Station Network is a decentralized network of relayers which allows dApps to pay the cost of transactions instead of individual users. The paymaster was missing validation of the Trusted Forwarder, which returns the amount of funds used by the relay worker to be refunded.
