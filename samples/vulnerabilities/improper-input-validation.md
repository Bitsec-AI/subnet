# Improper Input Validation

## Overview

Improper input validation is the predominant root cause of a substantial number of confirmed vulnerability reports submitted through Immunefi, as well as exploited in the wild. Input validation is a critical security practice that involves verifying the integrity, accuracy, and safety of data input into a system. Failure to validate inputs properly can open up avenues for attackers to exploit and manipulate the system’s behavior.

## Description

Improper input validation occurs when smart contracts fail to adequately validate and sanitize user inputs, leaving them vulnerable to various types of attacks. This type of vulnerability can be exploited to manipulate contract logic, inject malicious data, or cause unexpected behavior. Proper input validation ensures that only valid and expected data is processed by the contract, reducing the risk of exploitation.

## Prevention

To prevent vulnerabilities of this kind, developers should implement comprehensive input validation routines. This includes validating data types, checking for boundary conditions, and sanitizing user input to prevent unexpected conditions from occurring. It is essential to consider all possible input scenarios, including edge cases and unexpected inputs, in order to ensure robust input validation. Some tools and techniques that can help prevent missing edge cases for developers are fuzzing or symbolic execution. These tools can assist developers in testing a variety of inputs to ensure malicious inputs don’t break invariants or execution of their smart contracts.

## Examples

The Beanstalk Logic Error Bugfix Review showcases an example of a missing input validation vulnerability. The Beanstalk Token Facet contract had a vulnerability in the transferTokenFrom() function, where the msg.sender’s allowance was not properly validated during an EXTERNAL mode transfer. This flaw allowed an attacker to transfer funds from a victim’s account who had previously granted approval to the Beanstalk contract.
