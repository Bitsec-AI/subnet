If the mint function were to call an external contract (for example, if the minting process were modified to send Ether or call another contract), it could lead to a reentrancy attack. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly calling the mint function before the state changes (like updating totalSupply and mintedAddress) are completed, potentially allowing them to mint multiple NFTs."
