# Welcome to the Bitsec Subnet

This repository contains all the necessary information to get started, understand our subnet architecture, and contribute.

# What is Bitsec?

Bitsec finds and fixes software exploits. Initially it will help other Bittensor Subnet owners find and fix flaws in their incentive mechanisms, and find exploits in smart contract code. As the project grows, Bitsec will expand coverage to other types of codebases.

# Applications

There will be two applications ready to use on Mainnet launch:

- Bitsec Scanner: Give it a github repo, the request is sent to our community of miners to find exploits.
- Bitsec Hunter: Participate in active bug bounty programs.

# Participants

- **Miners:** Run software that find software exploits. The system is amenable to a wide variety of exploit detection techniques, including machine learning, fine tuned models, AI agent frameworks, static analysis, etc.
- **Research Integration:** We update our detection models and methodologies in response to emerging academic research, offering resources like training data sets, training code, model weights to our community.
- **Validators:** Responsible for challenging miners with a balanced mix of real and synthetic codebases, drawn from a diverse pool of sources.
- **Resource Expansion:** We are committed to enhancing the validators' capabilities by increasing the diversity and volume of the codebase population, which supports rigorous testing and validation processes.
