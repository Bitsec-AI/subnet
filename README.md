## Welcome to the Bitsec Subnet

Bitsec is an Ecosystem for AI-powered code vulnerability detection. It finds and fixes code vulnerabilities for subnet codebases and smart contracts. As the project grows, Bitsec will expand coverage to other types of codebases and vulnerabilities.

## Subnet Incentive Mechanism Reports

Since testnet, we have been evaluating subnet incentive mechanisms with critical, high, medium findings in mainnet.

These will be run regularly and summaries posted on X, with detailed findings on our website.

## Applications

The subnet incentivizes miners to develop models and workflows to find and fix code vulnerabilities. Applications allow paying users access to Bitsec's network of miners.

Here are two sample applications on the roadmap:

- <b>Bitsec Scanner</b>: Give it a github repo, the request is sent to our community of miners to find exploits.
- <b>Bitsec Hunter</b>: Participate in active bug bounty programs.

## Participants

- **Miners:** Run machines and workflows that find software exploits. The system is amenable to a wide variety of exploit detection techniques, including machine learning, fine tuned models, AI agent frameworks, static analysis, etc.
- **Research Integration:** We update our detection models and methodologies in response to emerging academic research, offering resources like training data sets, training code, model weights to our community.
- **Validators:** Responsible for challenging miners with a balanced mix of synthetic and real codebases, drawn from a diverse pool of sources.
- **Resource Expansion:** We are committed to enhancing the validators' capabilities by increasing the diversity and volume of the codebase population, which supports rigorous testing and validation processes.

## Questions?

Ask and participate in the Bittensor discord, look for the channel for subnet 60.

## Benchmark Suite

We have introduced a structured benchmark suite for vulnerability types, including real-world and synthetic contracts. The suite evaluates miner performance based on the following metrics:

- True/false positive rates
- Detection latency
- Report completeness

### Running the Benchmark Suite

To run the benchmark suite, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Navigate to the `benchmark` directory:
   ```bash
   cd benchmark
   ```

3. Run the benchmark suite:
   ```bash
   python benchmark_suite.py
   ```

### Interpreting the Results

After running the benchmark suite, a report will be generated in JSON format. The report will include the following metrics:

- **True Positive Rate (TPR):** The ratio of correctly identified vulnerabilities to the total number of actual vulnerabilities.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR):** The ratio of incorrectly identified vulnerabilities to the total number of non-vulnerable instances.
- **Detection Latency:** The average time taken to detect vulnerabilities.
- **Report Completeness:** A score representing the completeness of the vulnerability reports generated by the miners.

Use these metrics to evaluate and compare the performance of different miners.
